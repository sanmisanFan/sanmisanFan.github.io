  The proliferation of misinformation in journalism, often stemming from flawed reasoning and logical fallacies, poses significant challenges to public understanding and trust in news media. Traditional fact-checking methods, while valuable, are insufficient for detecting the subtle logical inconsistencies that can mislead readers within seemingly factual content. To address this gap, we introduce Skeptik, a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic approaches to analyze and annotate potential logical fallacies and reasoning errors in online news articles. Operating as a web browser extension, Skeptik automatically highlights sentences that may contain logical fallacies, provides detailed explanations, and offers multi-layered interventions to help readers critically assess the information presented. The system is designed to be extensible, accommodating a wide range of fallacy types and adapting to evolving misinformation tactics. Through comprehensive case studies, quantitative analyses, usability experiments, and expert evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Skeptik in enhancing readers' critical examination of news content and promoting media literacy. Our contributions include the development of an expandable classification system for logical fallacies, the innovative integration of LLMs for real-time analysis and annotation, and the creation of an interactive user interface that fosters user engagement and close reading. By emphasizing the logical integrity of textual content rather than relying solely on factual accuracy, Skeptik offers a comprehensive solution to combat potential misinformation in journalism. Ultimately, our framework aims to improve critical reading and protect the public from deceptive information online and enhance the overall credibility of news media.
